A well-planned move aligns lease expiry, search, negotiation, fit-out, and physical move so you avoid double rent or a rushed decision.

## When to start

Work backward from your lease expiry or renewal notice date.

- **12–18 months before expiry** — Confirm your notice obligations. Decide whether you will renew, renegotiate, or relocate. Start defining requirements (size, location, budget).
- **9–12 months** — Actively search and tour. Shortlist 2–3 options. Compare all-in costs and terms.
- **6–9 months** — Negotiate and sign the new lease. Allow time for landlord approval and legal review.
- **4–6 months** — Finalize design and tenant improvement (TI) scope. Permits and contractor scheduling can take longer in busy periods.
- **2–4 months** — Construction/fit-out. Coordinate with landlord and property management.
- **1–2 months** — IT, furniture, and move coordination. Give notice at current premises per your lease.

## Key decision points

- **Renewal vs move** — Compare the cost and hassle of moving to the cost of renewing. Sometimes renegotiating in place is better than relocating.
- **Overlap** — A short overlap (e.g. 1–2 months) between old and new lease reduces risk of being without space if fit-out is delayed.
- **Notice deadlines** — Miss a renewal notice deadline and you may lose leverage or be forced to hold over at higher rent.
- **TI and rent** — Tenant improvement allowance and free rent can offset higher base rent. Factor them into your total cost comparison.

## Simple checklist

- Note lease expiry and any notice-to-renew or notice-to-vacate deadlines.
- Define size (rentable sq ft), location preferences, and budget (all-in cost per sq ft).
- Search and tour; compare gross vs net and incentives.
- Shortlist and negotiate; get terms in writing before signing.
- Plan TI and permits; lock in contractors and move date.
- Notify current landlord on time; coordinate keys and handover.

Start early and align search, negotiation, fit-out, and move in one timeline to avoid costly gaps or last-minute decisions.
