Office rents in Calgary vary by location, building class, and lease structure. This reference gives you a practical frame for what to expect and how to compare quotes.

## Rent ranges (ballpark)

Calgary office rents are often quoted as dollars per square foot per year (e.g. $24/sf). Ranges below are indicative; actual numbers depend on building, floor, term, and incentives.

- **Downtown (Class A)** — Often in the mid-$20s to low-$30s/sf (gross). Premium towers and long terms can be higher.
- **Downtown (Class B)** — Typically low-$20s to high-$20s/sf. Good value for established buildings.
- **Beltline / inner city** — Often similar to or slightly below downtown Class B, with more character and walkability in some buildings.
- **Suburban (e.g. Quarry Park, Deerfoot)** — Can be in the high teens to mid-$20s/sf. Parking and highway access are part of the trade-off.

## Gross vs net rent

Quotes may be **gross** (rent includes base rent plus a share of taxes, insurance, and common-area costs) or **net** (base rent only; you pay operating costs separately). Modified gross is a middle ground. Always clarify which you are comparing.

For a quick comparison, convert everything to an "all-in" cost per square foot so you can compare total occupancy cost, not just base rent.

## What else affects your total cost?

- **Term length** — Longer terms often get better base rent and more tenant improvement (TI) allowance.
- **Incentives** — Free rent, TI allowance, or moving allowances reduce effective cost—factor them into your comparison.
- **Operating costs and caps** — In net leases, ask how operating costs are estimated and whether there is a cap or base year.
- **Parking** — Can add a meaningful amount per stall per month; confirm if it's included or separate.

Use size (rentable sq ft), term, and all-in cost per sq ft to compare options. Get quotes in the same format so your shortlist is based on real decision criteria.
